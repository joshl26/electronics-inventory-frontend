## Introduction

Electronics Inventory is a cutting-edge SAAS web app that efficiently organizes electronic lab inventory for both small businesses and individuals with ease. With its user-friendly interface, you can effortlessly keep track of thousands of small components and have complete command over your inventory from anywhere in the world. To take advantage of this revolutionary app, you must have an account.

Electronics inventory software is the best way to keep track of stock and ensure that your business has the right items in the right amounts.

It can provide you with real-time data on current stock levels and allow you to quickly and accurately reorder items when necessary.

It can also allow you to track and trace items from the moment they enter your inventory until the moment they are sold, providing you with an unprecedented level of visibility and control over your inventory.

Finally, electronics inventory software can help you easily manage pricing, discounts, returns, and other aspects of inventory management.

I am proud to say that I created this project from scratch as a capstone project for my career change into Software Engineering.

<a name="project-setup"></a>

## Project Setup

Electronics inventory uses Javascript so you will need node.js installed to run this application, which includes downloading its dependencies. If you don't have node installed you can get that [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You will also need `git` installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Next, open a git bash wherever you would like to store electronics inventory and run:

### Frontend (Client) installation

`git clone https://github.com/joshl26/electronics-inventory-frontend`

Once you have the project on your local machine you will want to open it in a new terminal window and run:

`npm install`

This command will install the client-side dependencies, this may take a bit of time.

Once the installation of the dependencies is complete you can start the project by typing the following command:

`npm run start`

and you will have the development version of the frontend (client) application running on:

`localhost:3000`

### Backend (Server) installation

`git clone https://github.com/joshl26/electronics-inventory-backend`

Once you have the project on your local machine you will want to open it in a new terminal window and run:

`npm install`

This command will install the server-side dependencies, this may take a bit of time.

Once the installation of the dependencies is complete you can start the project by typing the following command:

`node server`

and you will have the development version of the backend (server) application running on:

`localhost:3500`

You will also need to setup a few environmental constants with a .env file like this:

```
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URI=mongoURI
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=accessTokenSecret
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=refreshTokenSecret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=cloudinaryCloudName
CLOUDINARY_KEY=cloudinaryKey
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=cloudinarySecret
CLIENT_URL = http://localhost:3000/
SERVER_URL= http://localhost:3500/
```

and then modify your "/config/allowedOrigins.js" file to suit your particular requirements.

<a name="folder-structure"></a>

## Folder Structure

**Backend (Server) File Structure**

```
/electronics-inventory-backend
    /config
        /allowedOrigins.js
        /corsOptions.js
        /dbConn.js
    /controllers

        /userRoutes.js
    /views
        /404.html
        /index.html
    /server.js
```

I followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern when laying out this application. It is an architectural pattern used in software engineering to separate the representation of information from the user's interaction with it.

The MVC format for Node.js involves separating application logic into three distinct components: Models, Views, and Controllers.

Models are responsible for managing data and business rules within an application. They handle interactions between a database and controller by performing CRUD operations on objects stored in memory or persisted in databases like MongoDB.

Views are responsible for displaying output to the user interface as HTML pages, written using EJS (Embedded JavaScript).

Controllers are responsible for coordinating models and views by responding to user input and making changes to data when required. It acts as a bridge between view layer (user interface) and model layer(data access layer). Controllers also contain request handlers that interpret requests coming from users via URLs/HTTP methods such as GET/POST.

## Testing

I have written some unit tests to check the helper functions in my project, which ensure that information is correctly transferred from the backend to the frontend. Although these tests do not cover all aspects of my project or test any of its React components, they are still useful for verifying correct functionality.

Tests can be found in the electronics-inventory-frontend folder `/electronics-inventory-frontend/src/__tests__`

While in the root folder, running `npm run test` in the terminal will run the tests I currently have setup.
